            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs wasn't just a businessman — he was a visionary who saw the future before it arrived. Born on February 24, 1955, in San francisco, his story began with humble roots. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, Who nurtured his curiosity for tinkering and design. From those small beginnings came a man who would redefine industries and change how the world connects, communicates and create. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1976, Steve co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak in a small garage. That garage would become groun zero for a technological revoultion. The two young innovators built the Apple I, then the Apple II — machines that brought computing to ordinary people for the first time. Jobs didn't just want to build computers; he wanted to build tools for dreamers, creators, and thinkers. He wanted technology to feel human.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By 1984, The launch of the Macintosh showcased Jobs' Obsession with simplicity and elegance. The Macintosh wasn't just another machine — it was art. Its friendly interface, bold design, and creative advertising introduce a whole new philosophy: technology with personality. Jobs believed design wasn't just how something looked; it was how it worked. That principle became Apple's DNA.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But success didn't come without struggle. In 1985, Jobs was ousted from the company he helped create. Most would've stopped there — he didn't. Instead, he built NeXT, a company focused on high-end computers for education and business. Though it didn't dominate the market, its software would later form the foundation for Apple's future operating systems. Even in failure, Jobs was unknowingly laying the groundwork for his greatest comeback.</p>
